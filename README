NAME

	mlterm-gtk3

DESCRIPTION

	The mlterm original is on http://mlterm.sourceforge.net/ .
	I'm using mlterm on Fedora, and Fedora do not have a mlterm rpm.
	So, I'd like to build it.

INSTALL

	# dnf copr enable tom0/mlterm-gtk3
	# dnf install mlterm-gtk3

BUILD

	If you'd like to build it. First, you should install RPM Development Tools group.
	
	And then,
	
	$ git clone git://github.com/jptomo/mlterm-gtk3.git
	$ cd mlterm-gtk3
	$ rpmbuild  mlterm-gtk3.spec -bb
	$ rpm -Uvh /path/to/rpmbuild/
	
	or if you'd like to get SRPM, then,
	
	$ rpmbuild  mlterm-gtk3.spec -bs
	$
